# AAX-to-MP3 Converter
This program converts AAX files to MP3. This is (primarily) just an English translation of the original project, which can be found on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/aaxtomp3/source/HEAD/tree/)

## Install
1. Download the most recent [release](https://github.com/luop90/aax-to-mp3/releases)
2. Unzip the contents

To use, follow the instructions below.

## Usage
1. Install the Audible Manager, and download an audiobook.
2. Sign in into your audible account (in the Audible Manager application, it will ask you to do so.) Now the program can convert your audible files.
3. Start AaxToMp3GUI.exe, and select the file you want to convert
4. Click convert
5. Wait for the file to convert...
6. When the conversion is complete, the mp3 file can be found in the same folder as the AAX file

The conversion takes ~2 seconds for each 1 minute of audio, depending on computing power.
